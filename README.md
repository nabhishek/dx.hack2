This contains the code for the IoT solution for farmers that we did for the HACK. 

farmvilla-device-emulation is the code running as webjobs or as console app from any Windows machine to emulate sensor value periodically. for the hack we emulated multiple such devices and used 1 real device where the UWP code was runing. You can find the device code in ...$(deviceCode)
